## xydrag

> **Prototype warning!** xyDrag is still in development, not all features are available and some corner cases have not been implemented yet.

xyDrag (pronuced X-Y Drag) attempts to serve as a lightweight and solid base for custom draggable interactions. It has a plugin system which means you don't need to load the features that you don't need and you can write your own plugin to implement custom interactions without worrying about the details of making drag (and drop) work consistently in all scenarios on all devices.

The package uses a minimal amount of dependencies and almost all dependencies come from a single maintainer.
